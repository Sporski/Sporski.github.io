					<h2><b>A Little Bit About Myself</b></h2>
				</header>
				<pre>
I think it's best to start off with why I made a webpage. As you'll see if you
continue to read through, I have recently graduated from the University at Buffalo.
I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'd love to start my career
therefore, I am doing anything and everything to get my name out there and get noticed.
I'd say that my top goal right now is to become a software developer/engineer and
just enjoy coming to work every day.

I would describe myself as a hard worker and someone that will never give up
when faced with a challenge. Using the phrase "I don't know" is something I'm not
afraid of using either. Working is something that I think should be fun, because 
let's face it we do it a majority of our lives, so might as well enjoy it. Besides
just doing my job I try to make sure everyone has a good time and at some point has
a smile on their face. I like to joke around and keep everything light but I also
know when to be professional as well.

I think of myself as a strong coder and I truly like working on projects. The feeling
you get after completing a project is something I love. That sense of accomplishment
is an awesome feeling and helped me get through some of my tougher courses. Coding
is something I felt I could always just do, and I feel that I can pick up almost any language,
given some time of course. I look forward to what my future has in store and I cannot
wait to start my career as a Software Engineer!
